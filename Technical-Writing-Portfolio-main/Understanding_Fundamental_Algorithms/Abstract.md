### Abstract

Programming, at its core, is about solving problems, and algorithms are the tools that make this possible. This article is for beginners who are new to coding, aiming to demystify the concept of algorithms.

You've probably often heard the term "algorithms" as a beginner. But what are they, and why are they so crucial?

This article will guide you through the must-know sorting and searching algorithms, explaining their importance in computer science.

We'll take you through essential sorting and searching algorithms, explain why they are foundational to computer science, and provide practical examples to solidify your understanding.

By the end of this read, you'll understand what algorithms are, why they're essential, and how to implement them in your coding projects.
